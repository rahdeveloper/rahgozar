 * lx: SPEC 041 v2 — behavioural red/green test for the EARLY give-up rebind.
 * Field failure mode (the v1 field leftover, dump 2026-08-01): the v1 give-up
 * rebind heals a dead 5-tuple, but only at ~90s after the first demand — while
 * the user pings within the first 5-35s after device wake and sees every node
 * in ERR. The early trigger fires from the retry branch once >=3 initiations
 * went unanswered AND the session is provably dead (no live keypair, or last
 * handshake older than RejectAfterTime), shrinking the ERR window to ~15-20s.
 *
 * The test reuses the v1 harness (gateBind: first socket generation blackholes
 * every send) and drives the peer to the 3rd retry expiry — the state a real
 * ~15s of unanswered retries ends in. Post-fix the retry branch rebinds and
 * the tunnel comes up; pre-fix (v1 base) the retry keeps dying in the first
 * socket generation and only the ~90s give-up would heal, so the packet never
 * arrives within the test window.
 *
 * This file deliberately uses NO post-fix API, so it compiles and runs RED on
 * the v1 base commit.
